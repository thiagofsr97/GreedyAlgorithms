# GreedyAlgorithms
 A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving heuristic 
 of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global 
 optimum. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not in general produce an optimal solution, 
 but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global
 optimal solution in a reasonable time.
 
# How to use it!

- The compilation of the file is as simple as it follows:
Go straight to the root of the project using the terminal and type the following: <br />
'<b>cmake CMakeLists.txt && make</b>' . (with no quotation marks) 

- Make sure you have cmake pre-installed (Version 3.8 or above). <a href="https://cmake.org/download/">Cmake Download Webpage</a>.
- In order to run the program properly, you must run it from the terminal by typing the following parameters according to which Greedy Method Available and which path to read the input from a file: ./GreedyAlgorithms "1st param" "2nd param"
  
- The parameters must be chosen as it follows:
  - 1st: "dij" or "kru" or "prim", referring to Dijkstral, Kruskal and Prim algorithms, respectively.
  - 2nd: "path", referring to path of the file containing input. (Check examples in Input Examples to build your own).
